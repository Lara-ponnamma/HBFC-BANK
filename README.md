# HBFC-BANK

HBFC Housing Building Finance Corporation. To be the prime housing finance institution of the country, providing affordable housing solutions to low- and middle-income groups of population by encouraging new constructions in small & medium housing sector.
I have worked on HBFC bank .Here HBFC bank want to sell more personal loan to the customer who having savings account. The bank wants to start a campaign to sell the personal loans, but before that they want to analyze last marketing campaign data to understand the profile of potential loan customers.At present the bank has small number of asset customers. The bank wants to increase their income by increasing the customer base of “asset customers”
The main objective is to examine data from the previous marketing campaign to gain insights into the characteristics of potential customers who are inclined to apply for personal loans. This analysis will enable the bank to craft a focused marketing strategy with the aim of boosting the success rate while keeping costs to a minimum.

Data and Dataset:
The dataset provided contains information on 5000 customers. It includes customer demographics (such as age, income, and family size), details about the customer's relationship with the bank (like having a mortgage, securities account, etc.), and the customer's response to the last personal loan campaign (whether they accepted the personal loan offer).

Conclusion:
After analysis conclusion can be made like people who come under category of professional, fixed/deposit account, often prefer online transaction (internet banking) and income category falls under 100+. These people should be mainly focused and considered because they may accept more personal loans.
